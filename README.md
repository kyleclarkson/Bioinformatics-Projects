# Bioinformatics

This repository contains coding projects related to the area of bioinformatics, the intersection of biology, computer science, mathematics, and other disciplines. With a minimal background in biology, this repository serves to apply problem solving techniques from mathematics and computer science to problems in biology.

## Rosiland
*** WIP ***
[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a website for learning how to solve bioinformatics by allowing a user to submit solutions to problems that can be solved using programming techniques. The [notebook](https://github.com/kyleclarkson/Bioinformatics-Projects/blob/master/rosalind/bioinfomatics_stronghold_problems.ipynb) contains the problem definitions and code solutions in python.
